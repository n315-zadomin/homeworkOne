      <h1>Request for Comments: Strict Unary Operators</h1>
      <p class="under">Posted 15 June 2022 by Natalie Weizenbaum</p>

      <p>
        Do you know what margin: $a -$b does in Sass? If you said “the same
        thing as margin: $a (-$b), I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. It’s actually
        the same thing as margin: $a - $b. Don’t worry, you’re not the first
        person to get tripped up by this weird corner of Sass’s parser! But our
        new language proposal aims to fix that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <span class="bb">Strict Unary Operators proposal</span>, which is
        currently open for community feedback, we propose to first deprecate and
        then eventually disallow expressions of the form $a -$b. We know
        deprecations are never pleasant, but this should be fairly painless as
        they go: you can simply write $a - $b or $a (-$b), depending which you
        intend. We’ll also provide a Sass migrator migration to automatically
        update your stylesheets.
      </p>

      <!-- blog unordered lists -->
      <p class="bsl">Deprecated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          $a -$b will no longer be allowed, because it’s unclear what the author
          intended and the current behavior is likely to be incorrect.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="bsl">Still allowed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          $a - $b will continue to work, since it’s clearly supposed to indicate
          subtraction.
        </li>
        <li>$a ...</li>

      <h1>Embedded Sass is Live</h1>
      <p class="under">Posted 1 February 2022 by Natalie Weizenbaum</p>
      <p>
        After several years of planning and development, I’m excited to finally
        announce the stable release of Embedded Dart Sass along with its first
        official wrapper, the sass-embedded package available now on npm!
      </p>
      <p>
        Embedded Sass is an ongoing effort to make a highly-performant Sass
        library available to as many different languages as possible, starting
        with Node.js. Although Node.js already has access to the pure-JS sass
        package, the nature of JavaScript inherently limits how quickly this
        package can process large Sass files especially in asynchronous mode. We
        expect sass-embedded to be a major boon to developers for whom
        compilation speed is a concern, particularly the remaining users of
        node-sass for whom performance has been a major reason to avoid Dart
        Sass.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sass-embedded package fully supports the new JS API as well as the
        legacy API other than a few cosmetic options. You can use it as a
        drop-in replacement for the sass package, and it should work with all
        the same build plugins…
      </p>
