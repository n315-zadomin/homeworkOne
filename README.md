For the first assignent, we were to create an entire website with a minimum of four pages; we were to also use to BEM model if we understood it.
Personally, I think I need to do a bit more research of the BEM model before implementing it in my code. While reading about it however, I did conclude that it can be extremely useful to use and incorporate when I am more confident in my skills.

I decided for my first assignment to recreate as best as I could the https://sass-lang.com/ website. I kept the layout pretty much the same, but I did not pull absolutely everything verbatim. I decided to do this because in lecture, it was mentioned that our page should look professional, and it was encouraged to recreate the Sass website as well. I wanted to take this as an opportunity to test my skills and see how much of it I can recreate without getting stuck. I personally feel like I did a decent job for the first assignment, and I am optimistic that my skills will only improve as the semester goes on.
