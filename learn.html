        Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on your project. If you
        want to just browse here, go ahead, but we recommend you go install Sass
        first. <a href="install.html">Go here</a> if you want to learn how to
        get everything set up.

      <h1>Preprocessing</h1>
      <p>
        CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
        complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help.
        Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins,
        inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust,
        maintainable CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass
        file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass
        is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command.
        You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output
        CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your
        terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that
        file to output.css.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch
        flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes,
        and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch
        (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the
        watch flag to your command, like so:
      </p>

      <!-- code snippit -->
      <div class="codeBox">
        <p class="codeBox-text">sass --watch input.scss output.css</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your
        input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:
      </p>

      <!-- code snippit -->
      <div class="codeBox">
        <p class="codeBox-text">sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and
        compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
      </p>

      <!-- code snippit -->
      <div class="codeBox">
        <p class="codeBox-text">Fun Fact:</p>
        <p class="codeBox-text">
          Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (.scss) is used most commonly.
          It's a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS.
          The indented syntax (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation
          rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of
          semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in both
          syntaxes.
